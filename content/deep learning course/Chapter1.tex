\section{Types of Machine Learning Systems}
Useful to break down ML system types into 3 categories:

\begin{itemize}	
	\item based on supervision (labeling)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item supervised learning
			\item unsupervised learning
			\item semisupervised learning
			\item reinforcement learning
		\end{itemize}		

	\item based on incremental learning 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item online learning
			\item batch learning
		\end{itemize}		

	\item based on learning type
		\begin{itemize}
			\item instance-based
			\item model-based
		\end{itemize}		
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Supervised/Unsupervised Learning}
Classify according to amount and type of supervision during training.
\subsubsection{Supervised Learning}
Training data includes the desired solution called \textbf{labels}.
