                Hi! My name is Konrad Kadzielawa and I am a Chicago-based data analytics professional. <br>
                I have been involved in a variety of analytics-related professions ever since I started professional work. <br>
                This site is centered on the blog section where I intend to regularly post information relevant to analytics/data science and how it can impact your business. <br>
                I also offer services related to analytics - more available in the Services section of this website. Lastly, please click on the contact section to contact me with relevant inquiries. <br><br>
                Thank you!
